# MISP-RPM

This RPMs work with a clean Red Hat installation. There are no external repositories like EPEL, Remi PHP or others needed. They only rely on optional official RHEL repositories and software collections - you'll obviously need a valid RedHat subscription attached.

If you want to use a full fletched MISP version with all available features like misp-modules, see [https://github.com/amuehlem/MISP-RPM/](https://github.com/amuehlem/MISP-RPM/). For this installation you'll need additional external repositories like EPEL and Remi PHP.

## Install

See [INSTALL9.md](INSTALL9.md) for this specific RPM install on RedHat and refer
to upstream MISP documentation for anything MISP related and/or upgrade paths.
