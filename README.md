# MISP-RPM

This RPMs work with a clean Red Hat installation. There are no external repositories like EPEL, Remi PHP or others needed. They only rely on optional official RHEL repositories and software collections - you'll obviously need a valid RedHat subscription attached.

## Install

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for this specific RPM install on RedHat and refer
to upstream MISP documentation for anything MISP related and/or upgrade paths.

## Reporting issues

Please report issues on this branch to https://github.com/MISP/MISP-RPM and not
